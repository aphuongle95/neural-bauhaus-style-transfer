- Datasets:

1. Processed: Raw data
2. Ready to train: Datasets split into train and test 
3. Result train: Result of training the model
4. Result test: Result of testing the model

- Webapp:
1. pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix-webapp: modified repo for the webapp
2. python-image-flask.zip: python code to run a webapp for trying out the model (see final presentation)
3. To run:
    - put pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix-webapp and python-image-flask in the same directory
    - cd python-image-flask
    - python app.py

- Webcam: pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix-webcam
for running the webcam demo of some models
